# ACOUSLIC-AI baseline algorithm
The ACOUSLIC-AI baseline algorithm serves as an initial benchmark for the [ACOUSLIC-AI challenge](https://acouslic-ai.grand-challenge.org/) and a template to assist participants in correctly packaging their own algorithms.

## Algorithm
This algorithm is hosted on [Grand-Challenge](https://grand-challenge.org/algorithms/acouslic-ai-baseline)

### Summary
This algorithm selects the best frame for measuring the fetal abdominal circumference on a series of blind-sweep ultrasound images. Together with this frame, it provides the corresponding fetal abdomen binary segmentation mask. 

### Mechanism
This algorithm is a deep learning-based classification and segmentation model based on the [nnUNet](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet) framework. It was trained for one fold with an 80/20 train/validation split on the ACOUSLIC-AI Training and Development Dataset. The code to run inference using this baseline method is in `inference.py`.
