# ACOUSLIC-AI baseline algorithm
The ACOUSLIC-AI baseline algorithm serves as an initial benchmark for the [ACOUSLIC-AI challenge](https://acouslic-ai.grand-challenge.org/) and a template to assist participants in correctly packaging their own algorithms.

## Algorithm
This algorithm is hosted on [Grand-Challenge](https://grand-challenge.org/algorithms/acouslic-ai-baseline).

### Summary
This algorithm selects the best frame for measuring the fetal abdominal circumference on a series of blind-sweep d B-mode ultrasound images. Together with this frame, it provides the corresponding fetal abdomen binary segmentation mask. 

### Mechanism
This algorithm is a deep learning-based classification and segmentation model based on the [nnUNet framework](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet). It was trained for one fold with an 80/20 train/validation split on the ACOUSLIC-AI [Training and Development Dataset](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11005384). The code to run inference using this baseline method is in `inference.py`. For more details on this algorith, please refer to [An overview of the baseline algorithm](documentation/overview-baseline-algorithm.md).

# How to get started?
### Cloning the repository to your local system
We recommend that you begin by cloning this repository and packaging it into a Docker container. Once packaged, upload it as a [Grand-Challenge algorithm](https://grand-challenge.org/algorithms/) and submit it to the [Preliminary Development Phase](https://acouslic-ai.grand-challenge.org/evaluation/preliminary-development-phase/submissions/create/) of the challenge. This will help you become acquainted with the platform and ensure you can create a successful submission. Follow these steps to clone the repository to your local system:
1. Open a new terminal or command window.
2. Navigate to the location where you want to clone the repository by typing: \
    ```cd /path/to/your/desired/location```
3. Clone the repository with the following command: \
    ```git clone https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/ACOUSLIC-AI-baseline.git ```
